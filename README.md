# rock-paper-scissors-game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game. The program allows the user to play against the computer by selecting one of the three options: **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.

- This program created as part of my learning journey in the "100 Days of Code" course
